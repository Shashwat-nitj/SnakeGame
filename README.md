## Snake and Apple Game
Built game project in pycharm using pygame module in python

**Game is simple:**<br />
(1) When snake eats an apple it gets longer (depending on the mode selected) and your score increases. <br />
(2) If you snake hits any part of its body, or any rock, or in case of wall mode, boundaries of the window, it will die.<br />
(3) If no wall mode, on going through a wall, snake will get teleported to opposite side wall.<br /><br />

*Challenge yourself to establish highest score!!* (while enjoying catchy sounds)

### Challenges

(1) Making the snake head and tail turn at the point where user chooses to turn the snake.

(2) Making the game smooth so that snake doesn't run block by block, one at a time. (Still making sure that snakes and apple or rocks are at same lines)

(3) Handling overlaps (In some gameplays, random place alloted to the apple was the same as random place alloted by the rock.)
